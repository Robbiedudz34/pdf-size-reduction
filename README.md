## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Ghostscript** (latest version recommended)

Download Ghostscript here: [https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html)  
During installation, make sure to **add Ghostscript to PATH** so it can be called via `gswin64c` (Windows) or `gs` (macOS/Linux).
